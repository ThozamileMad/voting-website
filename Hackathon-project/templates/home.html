                                    <h2>South Africa's independence</h2>
                                    <p> The apartheid era, beginning in 1948, saw the implementation of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination, leading to increased domestic and international pressure for reform. The struggle against apartheid was marked by both peaceful protests and armed resistance, culminating in the release of Nelson Mandela in 1990 and the subsequent dismantling of apartheid policies. South Africa's full independence was finally realized with the first nonracial, democratic elections in 1994, leading to a majority rule government and the establishment of a new constitution. This transition marked the end of colonial and minority rule and the beginning of a new era in South African history.</p>
